## ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This portfolio is under constant development and will evolve over time.  
For now:
- Will start by using mock data from the Art Institute of Chicago API
- Includes basic pages (Home, About, Projects, Project Details)
- Will later showcase my real case studies and design work.

Later will be added to this README file...
